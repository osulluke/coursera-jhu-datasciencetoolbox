Week 1 notes:

	- good resource for R programming questions: http://bit.ly/Ufaadn
	- R mailing lists / Stackoverflow
	- data science has many different names, depending on the arena; i.e.Biostatistics, NLP, machine learning, econometrics, signal processing, etc.
	- reproducible research looks like a really cool class...basically how to ensure your analysis can be executed by someone else (automatically?) in an unbiased manner.
	- cool, I guess R has machine learning packages available.
	- building data products looks like a pretty cool class...maybe a product that gets data, analyzes it, and places it in a digestible context; that would be a cool project.

	This first set of lessons really was just a broad overview of what else is coming down the pike in the data scientist specialization track...seems like some pretty cool stuff.

	Well, I guess Coursera has decided to no longer allow free access to even the auto-graded quizzes...slightly disapointing...oh well...

Week 2 notes: 
	
	- quick little intro to git and github...nice, very quick overview; nothing I don't already know.
	- oooo! cool command 'git add -u' - this will add all the files in a repo that have changed, as opposed to 'git add .' which adds everything.
	- one bit of functionality Github has over git is the 'pull request'...this is what allows a project manager to determine whether or not to incorporate changes someone has made into the branch being 'pulled' against.
	- Markdown: This is an important subject; one I don't know anything about.
		- ## mark Secondary headings; ### indicate tertiary headings
		- * used in different lines make bulleted lists pretty easily.
	- installing R packages...the come from CRAN.
		a <- available.packages()
		head(rownames(a),3)
	that couple sequence of commands will show packages available for install.

		install.packages("slidify") will obviously install the package...this can be used as install.packages("a","b",...)

		tools -> install packages will let you do it from Rstudio

		library(package) loads the package into the current environment which makes those functions available...don't use ""...
		search() executed in sequence will then show you the functions (and packages?) available for use in your environment...I think...

	- installing Rtools...doesn't matter for Linux/Mac.

	...but no, seriously, it's pretty annoying you can't use the auto-quizzes...
